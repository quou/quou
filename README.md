Hello.

Here can be found some things that I will cringe at in the near future.

Note:
Since I don't really like GitHub very much, I'm switching to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/quou/). All of my new personal projects will appear [there](https://codeberg.org/quou/) instead of here, though some might still be mirrored here.
